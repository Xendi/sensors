WNYC sensor payload format

The format of a WNYC sensor payload is somewhat more permissive than
the actual messags that can be sent.  While some of the fields allow
for an arbitrary amount of data, the packets must fit within a 64k UDP
packet.  Additionally sensors that are not serial connected but
instead directly connected to a network via WiFi, Ethernet or GRMS
will have additional limitations.  The WNYC patched WiFishield stack
is limited to a 200 byte data gram; the GRMS device is limitd to 160 7
bit characters.


Communication from the sensor to WNYC is via UDP.  The BNF for the transmitted packet is as follows

# Packet identifier
packet = "cicadia-1\t" <source> <cicadia>
packet = "first responsder-1\t" <source> <first_responder>

source = <hash> "\t" <id> "\t"
hash = [0-9a-f]{16} # 64 bit hash of the sender's email address
id = [0-9a-f]{2} # The ID number for the sensor.  Each volunteer may setup as many as 256 sensors per email address

ciciadia = "1\t" <temp> <hit_miss>
temp = [0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?\t    # Temperature in Kelvin

hit_miss = <hit_count> <miss_count>
hit_count = <number> "\t"
miss_count = <number> "\t"

number = [0-9]+

first_responder = "1\t" <hit_count> <hit_miss>
